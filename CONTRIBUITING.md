# Contributing Guidelines [![contributions welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/contributions-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/openMF/web-app/issues)

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via an issue.

Do not open issues for general support questions as we want to keep GitHub issues for bug reports and feature requests. 
Remember that this is an inclusive community, committed to creating a safe, positive environment. See the whole [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Submitting or Requesting an Issue/Enhancement

### Best Practices for reporting or requesting for Issues/Enhancements:
  - Before you submit an issue, please search , maybe an issue for your problem already exists and the discussion might inform you of workarounds readily available.
  - Follow the Issue Template while creating the issue.
  - Include Screenshots if any (specially for UI related issues).
  - For UI enhancements or workflows, include mockups to get a clear idea.

### Best Practices for getting assigned to work on an Issue/Enhancement:
- If you would like to work on an issue, inform in the issue ticket by commenting on it.
- Please be sure that you are able to reproduce the issue, before working on it. If not, please ask for clarification by commenting or asking the issue creator.

**Note:** Please do not work on an issue which is already being worked on by another contributor. We don't encourage creating multiple pull requests for the same issue.

## Submitting a Pull Request

### Best Practices to send Pull Requests:
  - Follow the Pull request template and submit a pull request with a motive for your change and the method you used to achieve it to be merged with the `master` branch.
  - If you can, please submit the pull request with the fix or improvements including tests.
  - During review, if you are requested to make changes, rebase your branch and squash the multiple commits into one. Once you push these changes the pull request will edit automatically.

- **IMPORTANT: Don't make any type of `Pull Request` until & unless you get assigned to an `Issue`**
- Add screenshots or screen captures to your `Pull Request` to help us understand the effects of the changes that are included in your commits.
