## Submitting or Requesting an Issue/Enhancement

### Best Practices for reporting or requesting for Issues/Enhancements:
  - Before you submit an issue, please search , maybe an issue for your problem already exists and the discussion might inform you of workarounds readily available.
  - Follow the Issue Template while creating the issue.
  - Include Screenshots if any (specially for UI related issues).
  - For UI enhancements or workflows, include mockups to get a clear idea.

### Best Practices for getting assigned to work on an Issue/Enhancement:
- If you would like to work on an issue, inform in the issue ticket by commenting on it.
- Please be sure that you are able to reproduce the issue, before working on it. If not, please ask for clarification by commenting or asking the issue creator.

**Note:** Please do not work on an issue which is already being worked on by another contributor. We don't encourage creating multiple pull requests for the same issue.

## Submitting a Pull Request

### Best Practices to send Pull Requests:
  - Follow the Pull request template and submit a pull request with a motive for your change and the method you used to achieve it to be merged with the `master` branch.
  - If you can, please submit the pull request with the fix or improvements including tests.
  - During review, if you are requested to make changes, rebase your branch and squash the multiple commits into one. Once you push these changes the pull request will edit automatically.

- **IMPORTANT: Don't make any type of `Pull Request` until & unless you get assigned to an `Issue`**
- Add screenshots or screen captures to your `Pull Request` to help us understand the effects of the changes that are included in your commits.

Thank you for your contribution!!
